## 🧠 What This Is

This project captures the **eight-year journey** of Mc.William High School — from nervous first steps in 2018 to confident goodbyes in 2026.  
It’s more than photos. It’s **feelings preserved**, brotherhood documented, and stories you’ll revisit with a smile (or a tear). 0

> *“We were just kids with heavy bags and big dreams — now we’re legends of these hallways.”* 1
